    <h1> Bonjour tout le monde ici, I am Jack. This is my profile page.😊</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Jack Hsieh">
    <p>I love to play table tennis and I am a new beginner for horse back riding. I am taking the web developement class to improve my skills. Worked as an auditor in PWc before. Won the first prize in a real estate development contest during college. Knowing different fields of knowledge is my advantage. Familiar with the rules in appraising real estate and can provide a better point in auditing financial statement. Hope to participate in a bigger consulting project in Asian and European market. Currently, I am an master student in HEC.</p>

	<h2>Table Tennis 🏓</h2>
	<p>I am interested in palying tale tennis. Throughout my academic years, I not only get good grades but also am very active on sport field and involved in school club activities. Although studying and doing repots take up most of my time, I manage to spare some leisure time to play table tennis after school. I enjoy the team spirit we have. Our team won several contests between these two years because of our constant practice, hard work and our well team work. </p>

  <div class="card-white" id="Travel">
	<h2>Travelling ✈️ </h2>
	<p>I am passionate about travelling. During my exchange student period in France, I seized the opportunity to travel to many countries during my leisure time. I am not afraid to travel alone, rather, I like the feeling of solo travel because it pushes me to take the initiative to talk with different people.Everyone has their own culture and has their persistence. But I will try to listen with others and give them what I think without being aggressive. Overall, I think that this experience trained me to be more adaptable person and a good communicator in a team.</p>

 	<h2>Horse Back Riding🏇🏼</h2>
 	<p>I am fasinated with horse back riding. I had never tried this sport when I was young because this activitie is not a popular sport in Taiwan and it is some kind upper class sport for us. However, in my current study in Hec paris, I have the opportunities to participate in horse back riding class while making network with people in the same interest. The chance here is exclusive and I hope I can learn more the following classes during my study. </p>
